<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week I’m posting my visualization and brief analysis of the
<a href="https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity/status/988790036014485504">#TidyTuesday week 4</a>.
The challenge was about the disparity between men and women when analysing their
average incomes. The data provided was organized as follows:</p>
<div id="DT" style="width:100%;height:100%;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="DT">{"x":{"url":"/lcgodoy.github.io/post/2018/05/2018-05-02-wordcloud_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_data1.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>In the dataset, there are a lot of <em>composite occupations</em>, i.e., occupations
that have large descriptions or are composed of two or more different roles.
Due to it, I would like to see if there are words in these occupations that
appear more in female individuals. In addition, would be nice visualize the
average income associated with each word. To make this “average income per word”
comparable, it was categorized by its percentile.</p>

<div id="ingredients" class="section level2">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>data.table</code> - read the data;</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code> - for data manipulation;</li>
<li><code>magrittr</code> - it’s not just the <code>%&gt;%</code>;</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> - create the legend (certainly it can be done in a more efficient way);</li>

<h2>Reading and manipulating the data</h2>
<p>The following script will read the data and handle with two initial problems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Encoding</strong>: I’m a Linux user and the data came from Windows. To overcome encoding
problems, we need to switch the encoding to <em>UTF-8</em>;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Integer overflow</strong>: sometimes, in this data, integers are too large. As a consequence,
a summation of integers can return a <code>NaN</code>, when this integer exceeds a certain size. To
remedy this problem, we can turn these integers in numerics (probably not the smartest way to solve the problem).</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tm)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

Data &lt;- data.table::fread(
  (&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-04-23/week4_australian_salary.csv&quot;),

) %&gt;%

  mutate(occupation = iconv(occupation, from = &quot;WINDOWS-1252&quot;, to = &quot;UTF-8&quot;), # solving encoding problems
         individuals = as.numeric(individuals), # avoiding integer overflow
         individuals = as.numeric(individuals)) # avoiding integer overflow</code></pre>
<p>After that, I split the data by gender.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_split &lt;- split(Data, Data$gender) # split by gender
data_split$Total &lt;- Data # adding a list component with all data</code></pre>
<p>And then, created a function that returns the <em>frequency</em> each word appears
and the <em>average income</em> related to this word.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># if stem is TRUE, words will be &quot;stemmed&quot;

word_counter &lt;- function(data, stem = T) {

    aux &lt;- NULL
  }
  
  return(df_word)
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that, the package <code>tm</code> is used just to create a <code>data.frame</code> with one line
for each word. Then, <code>stringr</code> is used to detect the professions that
“match” with each word. Another important detail is concerned about the
calculation of the <em>average income</em>. Instead of using
<code>mean(aux$average_taxable_income)</code>, <code>sum(aux$average_taxable_income*aux$individuals)/df_word$freq[i]</code>
is used. The first choice would calculate the average wrongly. Because the average
income of a word that appeared one time would be treated in the same way that
a word that appeared a hundred times.</p>

<div id="almost-there" class="section level2">
<h2>Almost there</h2>
<p>Now, we just need to run the following script to obtain everything that wee need
to build the men and women wordclouds.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_counters &lt;- purrr::map(data_split, word_counter, stem = F)</code></pre>
<div id="creating-a-colour-palette-based-on-the-quantiles" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a colour palette based on the quantiles</h3>
<p>The colour palette was created based on the quantiles of the average income
considering both men and women. The palette goes from red to white to blue,
this means that red words are associated with low income and blue with high
income.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>col_pal &lt;- colorRampPalette(colors = c(&quot;#f71616&quot;, &quot;#ffffff&quot;, &quot;#283eff&quot;))
breaks &lt;- quantile(word_counters$Total$income, probs = seq(0, 1, by = .005))</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>white values are associated with median income. However, the distribution
of the average income is asymetric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following lines of code create a variable called <code>color</code> that indicates
at each quantile each average income is associated and the respective color.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_counters &lt;- purrr::map(word_counters, 
                            function(data) {

                                mutate(color = cut(x = income, 
                                                   breaks = breaks, 
                                                   label = col_pal(length(breaks) - 1)
                                )
                                )

</div>

<div id="word-clouds" class="section level2">
<h2>Word clouds</h2>
<p>Finally, we can create the desired word clouds and it can be done with a few lines
of code. For example, to create a word cloud for men execute the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wc_obj_men &lt;- word_counters$Male %&gt;% 
  filter(freq &gt; quantile(freq, .8)) # I&#39;m using just the 20% more frequent words.

men_colors &lt;- wc_obj_men$color

# Data structure utilized by wordcloud2
wc_obj_men %&lt;&gt;% select(word, freq)

(wc_men &lt;- wordcloud2::wordcloud2(data = wc_obj_men, color = men_colors,
                                  backgroundColor = &quot;black&quot;,
                                  shuffle = F, 
                                  size = .5))</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:480px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"url":"/lcgodoy.github.io/post/2018/05/2018-05-02-wordcloud_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_men_wc_print.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p><br></p>
<p>Similarly, if you want to visualize the women’s word cloud, run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wc_obj_women &lt;- word_counters$Female %&gt;% 
  filter(freq &gt; quantile(freq, .8))

women_colors &lt;- wc_obj_women$color

wc_obj_women %&lt;&gt;% select(word, freq)

(wc_women &lt;- wordcloud2::wordcloud2(data = wc_obj_women, color = women_colors,
                                    backgroundColor = &quot;black&quot;,
                                    shuffle = F,

<h2>Final Word Cloud and Analysis</h2>
<p>The word clouds below can be used to extract a lot of information about gender
inequalities in Australia in 2013-14. For example, take a look at the word office.
Despite the number of women that plays a role in an <em>office</em> is greater than the
number of men, Men have a much better salary at, probably, the same function.
If you analyze carefully both word clouds, you will be able to identify several
differences in the income associated with the same word in different genders.</p>
<p>In conclusion, even in Australia, a country considered developed, the problem
of not treating people of different genders equally exists. It’s a sad reality
that needs to be showed and faced.</p>
