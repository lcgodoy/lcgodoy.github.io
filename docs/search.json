    "text": "Neural Network Regression\nA neural network is a highly parametrized model that, provided we have enough data, can approximate any functional relationship between a set of features1 𝐱\\mathbf{x} and a response variable yy (Efron and Hastie (2016), pages 151-152). Although there are several possible structures for neural networks, for this post we are going to consider only the feed-forward2 neural networks. In order to explain how these neural networks are designed, let’s consider its graphical representation (see Figure 1). We have vertices, which are called a units (or neurons), ordered horizontally by layers. An edge coming from one vertex can only be connected to vertices associated with “higher” layers. These connections represent a information flow from left to right (hence, the name feed-forward), where each unit computed by 1) giving weights to each of its inputs, 2) calculating the dot product between weights and inputs, 3) adding a constant( usually referred to as bias) to it, and, finally, 4) applying an element-wise activation function f(⋅)f(\\cdot) to it. These activation functions are used to establish non-linear relationships between units.\nThe number of hidden layers as well as the number of units associated with every layer can both be regard as tuning parameters. The design and architecture of a neural network is a complex task. In summary, when having a single hidden layer, the number of units associated with the hidden layer determines the number of parameters associated with the model. Efron and Hastie (2016) suggest that, under this scenario, it is better to consider several units for the hidden layer and use some kind of regularization to avoid overfitting. Penalizations analogous to the Ridge and Lasso penalty for linear models are often used in the regularization context for neural networks (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Wainwright (2015), pages 210-211).\nAn important remark regarding the neural network models is that they are “pure prediction algorithms”. That is, these models are focused only on prediction, neglecting the estimation, as pointed by Efron (2020). The strategy is simple and consists in searching for high predictive accuracy. That being said, these algorithms make no assumption on the probability distribution of the data and, as one of the consequences of losing these assumptions, it is not possible to make interval predictions or to calculate confidence intervals for the “estimated” parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle neuron feed-forward networks\nA single neuron feed-forward network does not possess any hidden layer in its structure. The absence of hidden layers makes these models resemble the statistical models we are most used to, like, for example, the linear regression and logistic regression. By analyzing the graphical representation of a single layer feed-forward network (Figure 2), it is easy to see that by taking the identity as the activation function, the functional relationship between 𝐱\\mathbf{x} and yy considered by the neural network is equivalent to the one used for the general linear model. Considering the same representation, if we take f(x)=logit(x)f(x) = \\textrm{logit}(x) (sigmoid function, according to the neural network models literature) and y∈{0,1}y \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}, then the neural network provides the same relationship between 𝐱\\mathbf{x} and yy as the one used by the logistic regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A single layer feed-forward neural network.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the functional relationship between 𝐱\\mathbf{x} and yy assumed by the single layer neural network coincides with some statistical models, we cannot promptly claim an equivalence between models because the way the neural networks learn, that is estimates, the weights can lead to different solutions depending on the loss and cost functions selected, we are going to talk more about these functions in the next section.\n\n\nActivation functions\nActivation functions are applied in every “Layer connection” in neural network models. Suppose, for example, we have a design matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in {\\rm\nI\\!R}^{n \\times p}$, and a response variable 𝐲\\mathbf{y}. Then, given appropriate choices of the K−1K - 1 (one for each layer connection), the mathematical model, for a single observation, behind the neural network, can be written in a vectorial notation as follows 𝐳(k)=𝐖(k−1)𝐚(k−1)\n\\mathbf{z}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{W}^{(k - 1)} \\mathbf{a}^{(k - 1)}\n 𝐚(k)=f(k)(𝐳(k)),\n\\mathbf{a}^{(k)} = f_{(k)} \\left( \\mathbf{z}^{(k)} \\right),\n where $\\mathbf{W}^{(k - 1)} \\in {\\rm I\\!R}^{m_{k - 1} \\times m_{k}}$ is the matrix of weights that go from from the layer Lk−1L_{k - 1} to the layer LkL_{k}, $\\mathbf{a}^{(k)} \\in {\\rm I\\!R}^{m_k \\times m_{k + 1}}$ matrix of units at layer LkL_k, and f(k)f_{(k)} is a (element-wise) activation function used at the layer LkL_k. Note that, when k=0k = 0, then 𝐚(0)=𝐗\\mathbf{a}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{X}. Observe that mkm_k is the number of units in the layer kk and, consequently, for the input and output layers, respectively, we have m0=pm_0 = p and mK=1m_K = 1.\nFrom this example, it is clear that we can apply different activation functions when connecting different layers. Nevertheless, the activation for one layer is the same along all of its units.\nAlthough, theoretically, there exists no restriction on which functions to use as activation function, we want these functions to be at least one time differentiable. This is due to the fact that most of the methods used to find the optimal weights are based on gradients. Another aspect to be considered when choosing an activation function is the domain of the output variable yy. That is, if y∈[0,1]y \\in [0, 1], we want an activation function that maps real values to the [0,1][0, 1] interval. In summary, for the output layer, we use a activation function that makes predictions on the same domain as the output variable, while, for hidden layers, we have no restrictions on the activation functions, besides the ones already mentioned.\nSome commonly used link functions are the logit\\textrm{logit}, or sigmoid, function, defined as f(x)=11+e−x,\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}},\n the hyperbolic tangent function, referred to as tanh\\textrm{tanh}, f(x)=ez−e−zez+e−z.\nf(x) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^{z} + e^{-z}}.\n Note that the tanh\\textrm{tanh} is mapping from the real line to the (−1,1)(-1, 1) interval. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is also a popular choice and is defined as f(x)=x+=max(0,x),\nf(x) = x_{+} = \\max(0, x),\n the main advantage of this function is a cheap to compute gradient. A different version of the ReLU called leaky ReLU is also quite popular, its definition is given as follows f(x)=x+=max(.01*x,x),\nf(x) = x_{+} = \\max(.01 * x, x),\n\nThese are only some examples of commonly used activation functions and they are illustrated in Figure 3. The user does need to be restrict to these options since there are several other functions implemented in the software available to compute neural networks. However, if you want to use a activation function that is not implemented yet, you may have to implement your own version for the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The most popular activation functions (figure inspired by Figure 18.6 from Efron and Hastie (2016) ).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are no restrictions on the functions used as activation functions in the hidden layers (besides being differentiable functions), it is not advisable to use the identity function because it implies a waste of computational power. This is due to the fact that using a linear function in a hidden layer, makes the units from that layer a linear combination of the units from the previous layer. To make this clear, let’s prove that a Neural Network model with a single hidden layer collapses to a Generalized Linear Model when the identity function is used as the activation function.\nSuppose a nn-dimensional vector 𝐲\\mathbf{y} is assumed to follow a distribution 𝒫\\mathcal{P}, where 𝒫\\mathcal{P} belongs to the exponential family of distributions. Then, given a design matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in\n{\\rm I\\!R}^{n \\times p}$, the Generalized Linear Model for 𝐲\\mathbf{y} is composed by the random component, given by the probability density function associated with the distribution 𝒫\\mathcal{P}, the systematic component, defined by 𝛈=𝐗𝛃,(1)\n\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\n \\qquad(1) and a (canonical) link function g(⋅)g(\\cdot) such that 𝛍=g(𝛈).(2)\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = g(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}).\n \\qquad(2) Once we estimate the parameters 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, we have 𝐲̂=g(𝐗𝛃̂).\n\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = g( \\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} ).\n\nDefine now our Neural Network model having a single hidden layer with MM units. The activation function for the hidden layer is fh(x)=g(x)f_h(x) = g(x), that is, the same as the identity function. The weights we want to find are $\\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\in {\\rm I\\!R}^{p \\times 1}$, and $\\mathbf{W}^{(2)} \\in\n{\\rm I\\!R}^{M \\times n}$. The activation function for the activation layer is the previously mentioned canonical link function. Finally, let the loss be the deviance residual associated with the distribution 𝒫\\mathcal{P}, and the cost function be the average of the losses. Then, the mathematical representation of the Neural Network becomes 𝐳(1)=𝐗𝐖(1)=𝐚(1),(3)\n\\mathbf{z}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{a}^{(1)},\n \\qquad(3) because the activation function for the hidden layer is the identity. Then, we have 𝐳(2)=𝐚(1)𝐖(2)(4)\n\\mathbf{z}^{(2)} = \\mathbf{a}^{(1)} \\mathbf{W}^{(2)}\n \\qquad(4) 𝐲=𝐚(2)=g(𝐳(𝟐)).(5)\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{a}^{(2)} = g( \\mathbf{\\mathbf{z}^{(2)}} ).\n \\qquad(5) However, note that, by combining 3, 4, and 5 we get $$\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{y} & = g( \\mathbf{\\mathbf{z}^{(2)}} ) \\\\\n& = g( \\mathbf{a}^{(1)} \\mathbf{W}^{(2)} ) \\\\\n& = g( \\mathbf{X} \\underbrace{\\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\mathbf{W}^{(2)}}_{{\\rm I\\!R}_{p\n\\times 1}} ),\n\\end{align*}$$ which yields to optimal weights (see Fitting a Neural Network and Backpropagation, for more information on how to fit a neural network model) satisfying $$\n\\underbrace{\\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\mathbf{W}^{(2)}}_{{\\rm I\\!R}_{p\n\\times 1}} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}},\n$$ where 𝛃̂\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} is the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} that can be obtained using the Iterative Reweighted Least Squares for the model defined by the probability density function associated with the distribution 𝒫\\mathcal{P}, the systematic component 1 and a (canonical) link function 2.\n\n\nCost functions\nWhenever we want to fit a neural network to a dataset we need to specify a Cost function, which is usually based on loss functions. A loss function, in the context of Neural Network models, measures how far our predictions f(𝐱;𝐖)f(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{W}) are from the true value yy. Examples of commonly used loss functions, for a single observation, are the mean square error loss and the binomial deviance defined, respectively, as L(𝐰,𝐱;y)=12(f(𝐱;𝐰)−y)2,(6)\nL(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}; y) = \\frac{1}{2} (f(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{w}) - y)^{2},\n \\qquad(6) and L(𝐖,𝐱;y)=ylog(yf(𝐱,𝐰))+(1−y)log(1−y1−f(𝐱,𝐰)).(7)\nL(\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{x}; y) = y \\log \\left( \\frac{y}{f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w})}\n\\right) + \n(1 - y) \\log \\left( \\frac{1 - y}{1 - f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w})} \\right).\n \\qquad(7) The loss function 6 is usually employed when the output (response) variable assumes continuous values, while the 7 is used for binary output variables.\nAfter choosing an appropriate loss function, the cost function is defined as the average of the loss function over all the observation, that is C(𝐲;𝐱,𝐖)=1n∑i=1nL(𝐰𝐢,𝐱𝐢;𝐲𝐢)+λJ(𝐖),\nC(\\mathbf{y}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{W}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\nL(\\mathbf{w_i, \\mathbf{x}_i; y_i}) + \\lambda J(\\mathbf{W}),\n where J(𝐖)J(\\mathbf{W}) is a non-negative regularization term and λ≥0\\lambda \\geq\n0 is a tuning parameter.\nIn practice, we may have a regularization term for each layer, each one having its own λ\\lambda. Some commonly used regularization terms are J(𝐖)=12∑k=1K−1∥𝐰(k)∥2,\nJ(\\mathbf{W}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{K - 1} \\lVert \\mathbf{w}^{(k)} \\rVert^2,\n and J(𝐖)=12∑k=1K−1∥𝐰(k)∥,\nJ(\\mathbf{W}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{K - 1} \\lVert \\mathbf{w}^{(k)} \\rVert,\n where KK is the number of layers of our neural network model, and 𝐰(k)\\mathbf{w}^{(k)} is the vector of weights from the units in the layer LkL_k to the layer Lk+1L_{k + 1}. Note that, these two regularization terms are analogous to the Ridge and Lasso penalizations, and they play the exact same role in neural networks as its analogous versions do for the linear models (Efron and Hastie 2016). Mixtures of these two regularization terms, as in the elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005), are also common.\n\n\nFitting a Neural Network\nSupposing a user has set the number of layers, units, an activation function and a loss function, to fit a neural network we seek the set of weights 𝐖={𝐖(1),…,𝐖(k−1)}\\mathbf{W}\n= \\{ \\mathbf{W}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{W}^{(k - 1)} \\} such that the cost function is minimized, that is min𝐖{𝒞(𝐲;𝐗,𝐖)}. \n\\min_{\\mathbf{W}} \\left \\{ \\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{y}; \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{W}) \\right \\}.\n Therefore, the neural network fit has turned into an optimization problem. The most common algorithm used to solve this optimization problem is the Backpropagation algorithm, which is described in the next section for a general situation.\n\n\nBackpropagation\nBackpropagation (or gradient descent) is the method used to find the weights which minimize the chosen cost and loss functions for a given neural network. It is an iterative algorithm that is guaranteed to converge whenever the cost function has a single local minima (Efron and Hastie 2016). However, even if the cost function does not have a single local minima, the algorithm works fairly well. The updates for a weight matrix, 𝐖(k)\\mathbf{W}^{(k)} let’s say, is done as follows 𝐖(k)=𝐖(k)−α∂𝒞(𝐲;𝐗,𝐖)∂𝐖(k),(8)\n\\mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{W}^{(k)} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial\n\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{y}; \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{W})}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}^{(k)}},\n \\qquad(8) where α\\alpha is a tuning parameter called learning rate. The name backpropagation comes from the fact that the derivatives (or gradients) are computed according to something called a computation graph in a backward fashion. It is heavily based on the chain rule for differentiation.\nGiven initial values for the 𝐖\\mathbf{W} matrices, the method repeats the update rule 8 until convergence. Provided that the columns of the design matrix are rescaled to mean 0 and variance 1, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009) suggest the use of random starting values for the weights as uniform random variables on the interval [−.75,.75][-.75, .75]."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nThe Neural Network Regression models are very interesting but certainly are not magical as it is sold in the market. By the end of the day, these models consist of simple linear algebra allied to the use of element-wise nonlinear functions and optimization algorithms. Speaking on optimization algorithm, the gradient descent looks like a fixed-point iteration algorithm. These kind of algorithms have the advantage of not need the second derivative of the functions, however their convergence can be slow. I believe that using different learning rates for different parameters could improve the speed on which the algorithm converges.\nAlthough these models do not make any distributional assumption on the data, we can easily make it more suitable for certain distributions by working with the cost and activation functions on an appropriate fashion.\nThere are several variants of these models suited for different problems, like text and image classification, for example. The idea is the same, what changes is the way the researchers deal with the hidden layers. I think an interesting application is to try to use neural networks to estimate non-parametrically covariance matrices for spatial data."

The spatial structure of the data significantly impacts valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We introduce a valid correlation function for this model, accommodating diverse modeling techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios involve areal data, and another demonstrates its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications spanning fields such as public health and climate science.\n\n\nSlides"

Reliable estimates and forecasts of TB incidence rates are crucial to guide public health policies. This study focuses on the high-burden municipalities of Eastern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We propose a novel spatiotemporal model based on the Hausdorff-Gaussian process to analyze TB incidence data. This model incorporates spatial dependence dictated by the Hausdorff distance, allowing it to “borrow strength” from neighboring municipalities and generate more reliable estimates, particularly for smaller areas. Our analysis has two primary goals. First, we aim to generate accurate TB incidence estimates by incorporating municipality-specific characteristics through covariates and a spatiotemporal random effect. The model delivers trustworthy expected incidence rates, consequently allowing for calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Second, our model offers predictive capabilities, forecasting TB incidence rates one year ahead to support proactive public health planning. We demonstrate our model’s effectiveness and competitive performance against other specialized areal data models. The insights gained from this study can guide policymakers in developing effective TB control strategies.\n\n\nSlides"

The unique structure and geometry of spatial data demand tailored approaches for valid statistical inference. Traditional areal data models, often reliant on adjacency matrices, may not adequately capture the nuances of polygons with varying sizes and shapes. Data fusion models, while effective, can become computationally prohibitive for even moderately large datasets due to their reliance on intensive numerical integrals.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian Process~(HGP), a flexible model class that employs the Hausdorff distance to quantify spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We establish a valid correlation function for the HGP, facilitating its use in diverse modeling techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Seamless integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models expands its applicability, making it particularly well-suited for tackling change of support and data fusion problems.\nOur comprehensive simulation study and applications to three real-world datasets validate the HGP’s efficacy. Applications with both areal and fused spatial data demonstrate our model’s capabilities. Additionally, we adapt the HGP for spatiotemporal modeling of areal Tuberculosis data using a separable model. Results indicate that the HGP delivers competitive goodness-of-fit and prediction performance compared to specialized models. In conclusion, the HGP provides a versatile and robust framework for modeling spatial data across various types and geometries, holding significant promise for applications in fields like public health and climate science.\n\n\nSlides"

The misaligned data make it challenging to study the association between election outcomes and socioeconomic variables. Given that the voters are assigned to the nearest electoral sections, we use Voronoi tessellation to associate each voting station with a Voronoi polygon. Areal interpolation is used to change the spatial support of the socioeconomic data.\n\n\nSlides"

    "text": "George Box’s 1976 paper named “Science and Statistics” is famous for that “all models are wrong” quote. Unfortunately, The number of people who know this quote is larger than those who have read the paper entirely.\nThe paper provides interesting (and insightful) discussions that still apply to the field of statistics nowadays. In my opinion, one of the most remarkable things Dr. Box pointed out is about “Mathematistry,” he defines (or explains) it as follows: &gt; “Mathematistry is characterized by development of theory for theory’s sake, &gt; which since it seldom touches down with practice, has a tendency to redefine &gt; the problem rather than solve it.”\nLater on, in the same paper, he mentions how this “malady” (in his words) is harmful to statistics as a field. &gt; “An even more serious consequence of mathematistry concerns the training of &gt; statisticians. We have recently been passing through a period where nothing &gt; very much was expected of the statistician. A great deal of research money &gt; was available and one had the curious situation where the highest objective of &gt; the teacher of statistics was to produce a student who would be another &gt; teacher of statistics. It was thus possible for successive generations of &gt; teachers to be produced with no practical knowledge of the subject whatever. &gt; Although statistics departments in universities are now commonplace there &gt; continues to be a severe shortage of statisticians competent to deal with real &gt; problems. But such are needed.”\nWe still face these challenges (on many others he mentioned in that paper) in Statistics. Therefore, it would be nice to share this to make people think about it.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{godoy2021,\n  author = {Godoy, Lucas},\n  title = {All Models Are Wrong},\n  date = {2021-08-15},\n  url = {https://lcgodoy.me/posts/models/models.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nGodoy, Lucas. 2021. “All Models Are Wrong.” August 15,\n2021. https://lcgodoy.me/posts/models/models.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Details\n\nDate: Dec 05, 2024\nLocation: Belo Horizonte, MG - Brazil\nSlides\n\n\n\nAbstract\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, and Brazil exemplifies the complexities of controlling this infectious disease. Reliable estimates and forecasts of TB incidence rates are crucial to guide public health policies. This study focuses on the high-burden municipalities of Eastern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We propose a novel spatiotemporal model based on the Hausdorff-Gaussian process to analyze TB incidence data. This model incorporates spatial dependence dictated by the Hausdorff distance, allowing it to “borrow strength” from municipalities and generate more reliable estimates, particularly for smaller areas. Our analysis has two primary goals. First, we aim to generate accurate TB incidence estimates by incorporating municipality-specific characteristics through covariates and a spatiotemporal random effect. The model delivers trustworthy expected incidence rates, consequently allowing for calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Second, our model offers predictive capabilities, forecasting TB incidence ratesone year ahead to support proactive public health planning. We demonstrate our model’s effectiveness and competitive performance against other specialized areal data models. The insights gained from this study can guide policymakers in developing effective TB control strategies.\n\n\nSlides"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Details\n\nDate: Aug 4, 2024\nLocation: Portlant, OR\nSlides\n\n\n\nAbstract\nAccurate modeling of spatial dependence is pivotal in analyzing spatial data, influencing parameter estimation and out-of-sample predictions. The spatial structure and geometry of the data significantly impact valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models, while effective, rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model class utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We introduce a valid correlation function within the HGP framework, accommodating diverse modeling techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing change of support and data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications spanning fields such as public health and climate science.\n\n\nSlides"

Firstly, set up the VPN and log-in to the cluster using ssh, then navigate to the location where you transferred the container (.sif) to. Next, you will have to start a interactive job. If the workload manager used in the HPC that you have access to is SLURM, this can be done either with srun or fisbatch. To start an interactive job with srun use\n\nsrun --partition=&lt;partition-name&gt; --qos=&lt;queue-name&gt; --mem=64G --pty bash\n\nThe same task can be achieved with fisbatch (if available) with\n\nfisbatch --partition=&lt;partition-name&gt; --qos=&lt;queue-name&gt; --mem=64G\n\nEither of these commands will allocate your job to a specific node. It is important to save the name of the node that your job has been allocated to. Next, load singularity on that node as follows\n\nmodule load singularity/&lt;version&gt;\n\nThe penultimate step is to start the jupyter instance. It is done as follows\n\nsingularity exec --nv mycontainer.sif jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip='*'\n\nAfter executing the last chunk of code, the terminal will be “busy” and will provide three URLs, they will look somewhat like “http://127.0.0.1:8888/” this. Copy the last address provided by the output. The last step before being able to access the notebook through the provided address is to create a ssh tunnel. To do so, open another terminal window and execute\n\nssh -NL localhost:8888:&lt;node&gt;:8888 &lt;username&gt;@&lt;hpc-url&gt;\n\nwhere &lt;node&gt; should be replaced by the node to which the job submitted using srun (or fisbatch) was submitted to. This tunnel will keep the other terminal window busy to.\nFinally, copy the address provided by the notebook (e.g., “http://127.0.0.1:8888/”) and paste it into your browser."
