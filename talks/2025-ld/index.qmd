### Abstract

Predicting species' responses to environmental change is a critical challenge in
ecology. Traditional species distribution models (SDMs) often rely on
correlative relationships, limiting their ability to forecast distributions
under novel conditions. Dynamic range models (DRMs) offer a more mechanistic
approach by explicitly incorporating demographic processes (e.g., recruitment,
survival, and movement) that drive range dynamics. However, the complexity of
DRMs has hindered their widespread adoption. We introduce `drmr`, an open-source
`R` package that significantly lowers the barrier to entry for DRM
applications. `drmr` provides a user-friendly framework for building, fitting,
and projecting age-structured DRMs, leveraging the power of `Stan` for efficient
Bayesian inference. Users can readily relate environmental drivers to ecological
processes such as recruitment and mortality. There is also an option to allow
for movement and limit the age groups that can move. This flexibility allows
researchers to tailor models to specific ecological systems and test competing
hypotheses about the factors driving change in species distributions. The
package facilitates the integration of spatially and temporally explicit
environmental data and provides tools for model evaluation, visualization, and
projection under future scenarios. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate
that `drmr`-based DRMs outperform traditional SDMs in forecasting accuracy under
environmental change. `drmr` provides a powerful and accessible tool for
ecologists to develop and apply mechanistic DRMs. An application using Summer
Flounder data corroborates the findings of the simulation study.  Specifically,
the DRM's root mean square error of prediction was 43% smaller than that of the
comparable SDM. By explicitly modeling demographic processes and their
environmental drivers, `drmr` enables more robust predictions of species
distributions, contributing to improved conservation planning and management in
the face of global change.
