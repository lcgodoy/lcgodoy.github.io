### Abstract

Accurate modeling of spatial dependence is crucial for analyzing spatial and
spatiotemporal data, as it directly influences parameter estimation and
prediction accuracy. The unique structure and geometry of spatial data demand
tailored approaches for valid statistical inference. Traditional areal data
models, often reliant on adjacency matrices, may not adequately capture the
nuances of polygons with varying sizes and shapes. Data fusion models, while
effective, can become computationally prohibitive for even moderately large
datasets due to their reliance on intensive numerical integrals.


To address these challenges, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian Process~(HGP), a
flexible model class that employs the Hausdorff distance to quantify spatial
dependence in both point and areal data. We establish a valid correlation
function for the HGP, facilitating its use in diverse modeling techniques,
including geostatistical and areal models. Seamless integration into generalized
linear mixed-effects models expands its applicability, making it particularly
well-suited for tackling change of support and data fusion problems.


Our comprehensive simulation study and applications to three real-world datasets
validate the HGP's efficacy. Applications with both areal and fused spatial data
demonstrate our model's capabilities. Additionally, we adapt the HGP for
spatiotemporal modeling of areal Tuberculosis data using a separable
model. Results indicate that the HGP delivers competitive goodness-of-fit and
prediction performance compared to specialized models. In conclusion, the HGP
provides a versatile and robust framework for modeling spatial data across
various types and geometries, holding significant promise for applications in
fields like public health and climate science.
