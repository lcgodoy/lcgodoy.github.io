### Abstract

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, and Brazil
exemplifies the complexities of controlling this infectious disease. Reliable
estimates and forecasts of TB incidence rates are crucial to guide public health
policies. This study focuses on the high-burden municipalities of Eastern Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil. We propose a novel spatiotemporal model based on the
Hausdorff-Gaussian process to analyze TB incidence data. This model incorporates
spatial dependence dictated by the Hausdorff distance, allowing it to "borrow
strength" from neighboring municipalities and generate more reliable estimates,
particularly for smaller areas. Our analysis has two primary goals. First, we
aim to generate accurate TB incidence estimates by incorporating
municipality-specific characteristics through covariates and a spatiotemporal
random effect. The model delivers trustworthy expected incidence rates,
consequently allowing for calculating standardized incidence ratios
(SIRs). Second, our model offers predictive capabilities, forecasting TB
incidence rates one year ahead to support proactive public health planning. We
demonstrate our model's effectiveness and competitive performance against other
specialized areal data models. The insights gained from this study can guide
policymakers in developing effective TB control strategies.
