### Abstract

In Brazil, socioeconomic data are available at census tracts (polygons), while
election data are available at voting locations (point-referenced). The
misaligned data make it challenging to study the association between election
outcomes and socioeconomic variables. Given that the voters are assigned to the
nearest electoral sections, we use Voronoi tessellation to associate each voting
station with a Voronoi polygon. Areal interpolation is used to change the
spatial support of the socioeconomic data.
