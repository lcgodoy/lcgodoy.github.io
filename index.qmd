Hello there. It's Lucas. I recently earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from
UConn. Soon after graduating, I have begun working with species distribution as
a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Global Change Research
Group](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/) at UCSC. My research interests
primarily revolve around statistical computing, Bayesian inference, spatial
statistics, and exploring innovative applications of statistical
methodologies. Apart from that, I enjoy learning about programming languages and
playing football (or soccer, pff).


In this website, you'll find some of my blog posts, mainly discussing R or
statistical concepts, as well as my CV, publications, and (someday) ongoing
projects.
